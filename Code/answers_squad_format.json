Combining AR and the IoT allows employees, such as field maintenance workers, to access vital machine operating statistics to assist in maintenance decisions, or an assembly worker to visually receive pick and place instructions and alerts if tools are working incorrectly or are out of tolerance.\n \nKey AR ecosystem components include device hardware, an OS open to third-party application development, and a platform for software, as well as content creation and management. The standard device hardware for viewing AR applications has predominantly been smartphones and tablets due to their wide availability and exceptional compute power. The newer devices expected to accelerate enterprise AR adoption because they allow hands-free access to information are smart glasses, HMDs, and other digital eyewear solutions from companies such as Microsoft, ODG, Epson, and Vuzix.\n \n \nMarker-based Systems: This technology uses physical-world symbols as a reference point for computer graphics to be overlaid. For example, a 2-dimensional printed marker is placed in front of a webcam. The computer then interprets this symbol to overlay an on-screen graphic as if it were directly on top of the marker in the physical world. There have been several notable uses, most commonly in marketing\n \nMarkerless Systems: By contrast, this technological approach has given rise to �mobile augmented reality�, denoting use of the technology with devices such as smartphones and tablets. This method uses a combination of an electronic devices� accelerometer, compass and location data (such as the Global Positioning System � GPS) to determine the position in the physical world, which way it is pointing and on which axis the device is operating. This location data can them be compared to a database to determine what the device is looking at, and thus allows computer data/graphics to be displayed on-screen.\n \n1.

This changes the view of safety itself; it is regarded less as a hardware characteristic and more as a cross-device function. This approach allows processes to be operated in a safely controlled manner without any need to interrupt them immediately every time a fault occurs. But the dynamic approach can only be implemented efficiently if functional safety is built into automation projects from the moment they are planned.",

Collaborative robots can be programmed onsite by the employees and can be quickly re-tasked to do multiple jobs quickly. They are lightweight and can be moved around easily in the production facility.   Collaborative robot have integrated sensors, passive compliance or over current detection as safety features. The integrated sensors will feel external forces and, if this force is too high, the robot will stop its movement. Passive compliance is produced by mechanical components. If an external force acts on a joint, this joint will submit itself to this force. So, in case of a collision, the joint will move in the opposite direction avoiding any injury. Also, an over current can be detected when a collision occurs. This is another safety feature, because the software can generate a security stop when it detects a current spike.\n Some of the applications of collaborative robots can be:   Assembly Soldering Vision based quality inspection Machine Tending Gluing Screwing Pick and place Operating hand tools Laboratory work  \n",
