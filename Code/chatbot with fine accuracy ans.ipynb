       "'[CLS] being able to assist customers remotely, service technicians could support their customers at any time and from anywhere, without necessarily having to visit the customer site. remote access could also help to better prepare service technicians with the necessary information for their tasks. knowing about the machine or system error in more detail beforehand saves valuable time because required spare parts or other equipment can ordered, prepared and brought along. moreover, due to a shorter reaction time, the customers machines are up and running much faster, saving them from costly downtime. for a machine and equipment manufacturer, using remote access also means that the same number of service technicians could support more customers or offer additional services. a secure remote connection to distributed machinery and equipment is also the basis for many new concepts and services within industry 4. 0 such as predictive maintenance, where a secure connection is established to collect data from machines, equipment or devices. the data is than analyzed and used to detect errors and possible failures at an early stage to avoid unplanned downtime.
