The smart companies of the future will be those that have a clear strategy for how and where 3D printing fits within their supply chain and their value chain. They will also understand the business drivers to adoption.\n \nFrom the student�s study to the professional designer�s office, from the dental laboratory to the jewellery retailer, from the aerospace factory to the hospital basement, 3D printers have become invaluable business tools. Applications and reasons are as diverse as the users. What links all these applications and users is one underlying ability: to transition 3D information digitally and seamlessly from the virtual world to the real world with nothing but a computer and a3D printer � from bytes to bits.\n \nThe benefits of 3D printing today go way beyond just making models and prototypes. 3D printing is becoming a way of making components, systems and products sold across the supply chain, from the bracket in the aircraft door to the dental aligner in the teenager�s mouth. It can also be used for the manufacturing of tools, jigs and fixtures in addition to rapid prototyping.\n\n",

Because this approach is very much hardware-based and therefore static, it is not particularly suitable for intelligent manufacturing processes where plant layouts continually need to be changed. A hard shutdown is generally associated with further disadvantages, whether these involve loss of productivity, extended downtimes due to more complex recommissioning procedures or a restriction in the machine�s operating and maintenance concept.\n \nAn alternative is offered by dynamic safety concepts based on an integrated view of changing automation processes and functional safety requirements. This changes the view of safety itself; it is regarded less as a hardware characteristic and more as a cross-device function. This approach allows processes to be operated in a safely controlled manner without any need to interrupt them immediately every time a fault occurs. But the dynamic approach can only be implemented efficiently if functional safety is built into automation projects from the moment they are planned.",

This cell is an assembly line where components of a main part gets assembled, the main part comprises of minimum of 7 sub-parts and more, which are then assembled by placing, inserting and part-screwing the main part. It has multiple stations which performs operation on the parts (like valve body assembly, vision inspection, testing, packaging). The main feature of the cell is exhibited using the programming, control and diagnosis of the robotic manipulator amongst other peripheral and safety devices. We call it as Multi Process robotic cell because it can be used for more than one manufacturing process. \n There are different stations in the robotic cell:\n 1. Conveyor Station: Use to transfer the inventory tray or pallet to the place where robot can pick them.2. Assembly Station: All the parts (axisymmetric and prismatic parts) will be assembled and screwed on the valve body in this station. Along with that inventory scanning and vision inspection of the valve bodies will be done.3.Testing Station: All the pneumatic ports of the valve body will be tested in this station. If there is any leakage, valve body will be rejected.4. Hex-nut Assembly Station:- Hex nut will be assembled on the body in this station.5. Packaging Station: Assembled valve bodies will be placed in a box and packaging is done. A printing head will print the required details( type of bodies, number of bodies, date of assembly etc)  on the box and then the box will be dispatched.

Variety of parts for simultaneous production 2. Change of schedule\n3. Ready for new partWorkstations and layout design :Workstations in the cell are as per the following given applications and subject to following parameters : 1. Load/Unload stations for the cell: It is the area where the raw materials are incepted in/out of the cell.2. Inventory storage area: An inventory storage where the storage of the raw material is kept.3. Inspection area: An area where the material post operations are inspected for quality. This is kept as a separate unit away from the cell but it can be an integral part of the cell itself.4. Operations area: An area where the operations like welding is performed. In the cell , this area is more of a workspace since two robots are responsible for performing welding on the material. And it can be anywhere in the robot's workspace. 5. Layout design: It is an integral part before identifying the robots and environment preparation and also plays a key role in safety of the cell.CAD Design & Simulation:The 3D visualization and detailing of the cell is done using a designing software. The robotic path simulation software asists in defining the best possible, collision free environment that is going to be the basis of the layout design and all other hardware that are going to be installed in the cell. Apart from designing & fabrication of the cell it helps in performing the robot simulations to generate offline program, collision free environment (this is how the level of flexibility achieved) for robots at operating stage and generating Augmented Reality applications. Video Description The cell programming can be done in atleast two ways. Online programming where  teach pendant is used and other is offline programming where the simulation is done in a separate software like RoboDK and KUKA Sim4. This helps in visualising and performing collision free path generation for both the robots. The video below demonstrates the offline programming method where we can see two robots performing indexed type motion.

These digital models have the ability to run experiments and what-if scenarios without disturbing existing production systems or � when used in the planning process � long before the real production systems are installed. Extensive analysis tools, such as bottleneck analysis, statistics and charts give us an opportunity to evaluate different manufacturing scenarios.\n The results provide us with the information needed to make fast, reliable, smarter decisions in the early stages of production planning. In addition, we can also optimize material flow, resource utilization and logistics for all levels of plant planning from global production facilities, through local plants, to specific lines. This helps to fulfil the user�s need to deliver just-in-time (JIT) or just-in-sequence (JIS).\n  Benefits Increase existing system productivity Optimize resource consumption and re-use Optimize systems for reduced energy consumption Shorten new product introduction, time-to market, and time-to-volume Improve production layout and minimize investments Ensure that machines and equipment are in the right place Ensure that sufficient material handling equipment is available Optimize buffer sizes Ensure that product handling is kept to a minimum\n\nApart from advance simulation another disruptive innovation is the concept of digital twin. With the growing deployments of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, the importance of the concept of a digital avatar of a physical thing has gathered significant interest in the recent years. A digital twin can be defined, fundamentally, as an evolving digital profile of the historical and current behavior of a physical object or process that helps optimize business performance.\n\nA digital twin enables flexibility in manufacturing to reduce time needed for product design, manufacturing process and system planning and production facility design. A digital twin improves quality and even supports new business models that offer opportunities for small- to mid-size companies to expand and bring more high-tech capability into their shops.  Digital twin business values: Quality Improve overall quality Predict and detect quality trend defects sooner Warranty cost and services Understand current configuration of equipment in the field to be able to service more efficiently Proactively and more accurately determine warranty and claims issues to reduce overall warranty cost and improve customer experiences Operations cost Improve product design and engineering change execution Improve performance of manufacturing equipment Record retention and serialization Create a digital record of serialized parts and raw materials to better manage recalls and warranty claims and meet mandated tracking requirements New product introduction cost and lead time Reduce the time to market for a new product Reduce overall cost to produce new product Revenue growth opportunities � Identify products in the field that are ready for upgrade\n   Improve efficiency and cost to service product\n\n  \n",
