       "'[CLS] being able to assist customers remotely, service technicians could support their customers at any time and from anywhere, without necessarily having to visit the customer site. remote access could also help to better prepare service technicians with the necessary information for their tasks. knowing about the machine or system error in more detail beforehand saves valuable time because required spare parts or other equipment can ordered, prepared and brought along. moreover, due to a shorter reaction time, the customers machines are up and running much faster, saving them from costly downtime. for a machine and equipment manufacturer, using remote access also means that the same number of service technicians could support more customers or offer additional services. a secure remote connection to distributed machinery and equipment is also the basis for many new concepts and services within industry 4. 0 such as predictive maintenance, where a secure connection is established to collect data from machines, equipment or devices. the data is than analyzed and used to detect errors and possible failures at an early stage to avoid unplanned downtime.

This new form of collaboration opens up previously inconceivable possibilities for the smart factory of the future. As collaborative robots operate without physical safeguards, they have to permanently calculate the risk of colliding with humans, constantly checking this via the robot controller.   Collaborative robots works hand in hand with the operator, thereby enabling him to work more efficiently, more ergonomically, more precisely and with greater concentration. As a robot that can genuinely be deployed universally, it is defining new standards on the road to the fourth industrial revolution. Collaborative robots can be programmed onsite by the employees and can be quickly re-tasked to do multiple jobs quickly. They are lightweight and can be moved around easily in the production facility.   Collaborative robot have integrated sensors, passive compliance or over current detection as safety features. The integrated sensors will feel external forces and, if this force is too high, the robot will stop its movement. Passive compliance is produced by mechanical components. If an external force acts on a joint, this joint will submit itself to this force. So, in case of a collision, the joint will move in the opposite direction avoiding any injury. Also, an over current can be detected when a collision occurs. This is another safety feature, because the software can generate a security stop when it detects a current spike. Some of the applications of collaborative robots can be:   Assembly  Soldering Vision based quality inspection Machine Tending Gluing Screwing Pick and place Operating hand tools Laboratory work   ,  Multi Process Robotic Cell demonstrates a flexible manufacturing cell.

AR applications can become even more powerful by augmenting them with data generated by another set of technologies, revolutionizing the marketplace called the Internet of Things (IoT). Combining AR and the IoT allows employees, such as field maintenance workers, to access vital machine operating statistics to assist in maintenance decisions, or an assembly worker to visually receive pick and place instructions and alerts if tools are working incorrectly or are out of tolerance.   Key AR ecosystem components include device hardware, an OS open to third-party application development, and a platform for software, as well as content creation and management. The standard device hardware for viewing AR applications has predominantly been smartphones and tablets due to their wide availability and exceptional compute power. The newer devices expected to accelerate enterprise AR adoption because they allow hands-free access to information are smart glasses, HMDs, and other digital eyewear solutions from companies such as Microsoft, ODG, Epson, and Vuzix.   Augmented reality renders 3D objects in real time into your field of vision. For example, looking through the cover of a machine and seeing its internal component structure.   Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology enriching the real world with digital information and media, such as 3D models and videos, overlaying in real-time the camera view of your smartphone, tablet, PC or connected glasses.   On the spectrum between virtual reality, which creates immersive, computer-generated environments, and the real world, augmented reality is closer to the real world. Augmented reality adds graphics, sounds, haptic feedback and smell to the natural world as it exists. Both video games and cell phones are driving the development of augmented reality.   The methods by which AR is achieved can generally be split into two broad categories: Marker-based, and markerless.   Marker-based Systems: This technology uses physical-world symbols as a reference point for computer graphics to be overlaid. For example, a 2-dimensional printed marker is placed in front of a webcam. The computer then interprets this symbol to overlay an on-screen graphic as if it were directly on top of the marker in the physical world. There have been several notable uses, most commonly in marketing   Markerless Systems: By contrast, this technological approach has given rise to \\u2018mobile augmented reality\\u2019, denoting use of the technology with devices such as smartphones and tablets. This method uses a combination of an electronic devices\\u2019 accelerometer, compass and location data (such as the Global Positioning System \\u2013 GPS) to determine the position in the physical world, which way it is pointing and on which axis the device is operating. This location data can them be compared to a database to determine what the device is looking at, and thus allows computer data/graphics to be displayed on-screen.   Applications of AR in industrial environment: 1. Data Reuse: AR applications allow more efficient reuse of existing enterprise application data. Enterprise application data can include maintenance records, service tickets, and usage logs\\u2014any combination of which can be tapped into to decorate an AR experience that blends the physical and digital worlds. 2. Data Contextualization: AR applications can be used to better contextualize information across a range of industries and job functions. In manufacturing, this could mean giving linemen and plant personnel the ability to abstract backend systems information for 3D product navigation, step-by-step work instructions, and remote visual guidance. 3. Work Error Reduction: AR applications can reduce errors made by workers in various occupational tasks. Whether the error is caused by too little information, too much information, or poor quality information, AR applications place the right information and instructions at the location of the work task. 4. Workforce Multiplier: AR applications are a workforce multiplier in two ways. First, training resources are more effective and efficient. Training hours can be reduced because AR applications can include video instructions on repair/replacement tasks overlaid on the machines themselves. Second, workers can do more by themselves versus sending multiple workers or truck rolls to address the same problem or work task. 5. Safety: AR applications can also improve the safety of a work task. For instance, AR applications can include not only written instructions for removing or replacing a part on a machine, but can also include visual instructions. This assistance avoids unnecessary and possibly unsafe interaction with the machine or object.  ,  The Mobile Collaborative Robot (MCR) is developed to achieve autonomous material transportation within the Cyber Physical Factory. The MCR consists of a TM5M700 collaborative robot mounted on top of an Addverb Automated Mobile Robot (AMR). The AMR uses a LIDAR and two depth cameras to navigate using Natural Navigation. It has a payload of 150 kg. The AMR runs on Robot Operating System (ROS). The collaborative robot mounted on top of the AMR has a camera on it. The cobot can be programmed using ROS or the TMFlow software. The feed from the camera can be used for object detection. The cobot has a payload of 6 Kg. The MCR can also be controlled using a Fleet Management System.

Today, drivers such as technology, sustainability, optimization and the need to meet customer demands have once again encouraged the transformation of the manufacturing industry to become adaptive, fully connected, and aware of its own power quality. One of the most significant trends in manufacturing is of improved information technology solutions involving the union of conventional automation with the information technology. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are enabling technologies which bring the virtual and physical worlds together to create a truly networked world in which intelligent objects communicate and interact with each other. They are \\ enabling technologies\\  which make multiple innovative applications and processes a reality as the boundaries between the real and virtual worlds disappear. Cyber-physical systems provide the basis the creation of an Internet of Things (IoT) which makes smart services and products possible. A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a  thing in the Internet of Things. It is a combination of mechanical, electronic and software components that communicate via a data infrastructure such as the Internet, react flexibly to external influences and exchange data with information systems and other CPSs. In manufacturing facilities, cyber-physical systems will communicate with intelligent, networked industrial production and logistics units-also known as cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). The CPSs exchange information, trigger actions in production and reciprocally control themselves autonomously. This enables industrial processes in manufacturing, engineering, use of materials, supply chain management and life cycle management to be fundamentally restructured and optimized.   Currently, manufacturing data are segmented, detailed and planned for a single scope, stored within the legacy systems, thus preventing the digital continuity that would let use them in the optimal way, independently from where and how they have been collected. Cyber Physical System (CPS) will instead be able to provide the needed information from the physical world while cyber-physical-collaboration environment will enable an efficient analysis, management, sharing and usage of the data and the knowledge elaborated from them and from the experience of involved people. Cyber-physical systems also represent a paradigm break from existing business and market models, as revolutionary new applications, service providers and value chains become possible.  ,  Being able to assist customers remotely, service technicians could support their customers at any time and from anywhere, without necessarily having to visit the customer site. Remote access could also help to better prepare service technicians with the necessary information for their tasks. Knowing about the machine or system error in more detail beforehand saves valuable time because required spare parts or other equipment can ordered, prepared and brought along. Moreover, due to a shorter reaction time, the customer\\u2019s machines are up and running much faster, saving them from costly downtime.   For a machine and equipment manufacturer, using remote access also means that the same number of service technicians could support more customers or offer additional services.   A secure remote connection to distributed machinery and equipment is also the basis for many new concepts and services within Industry 4.0 such as predictive maintenance, where a secure connection is established to collect data from machines, equipment or devices. The data is than analyzed and used to detect errors and possible failures at an early stage to avoid unplanned downtime. ,  Software used for AR : Here are various software we are using for the smart manufacturing purpose in AR. ,   It is an AR application designed and developed to provide a complete 3D CAD model of the FSM Smart Kits.

Smart Sensors already today support dynamic, real-time-optimized, and self-organized industry processes. ,  Being able to assist customers remotely, service technicians could support their customers at any time and from anywhere, without necessarily having to visit the customer site. Remote access could also help to better prepare service technicians with the necessary information for their tasks. Knowing about the machine or system error in more detail beforehand saves valuable time because required spare parts or other equipment can ordered, prepared and brought along. ,  The world of automation is merging with the IT world. Safety & security is an important prerequisite for the function of Industry 4.0 systems, which in contrast to traditional production plants have interfaces to their environment. ,  An Augmented reality application that allows the user to understand about the mechanism kit and scan the image target and place a CAD model of the Mechanism Kit to understand it clearly.

Simulation helps to create digital models of products, production systems, logistic systems so that one can explore a system\\u2019s characteristics and optimize its performance. These digital models have the ability to run experiments and what-if scenarios without disturbing existing production systems or \\u2013 when used in the planning process \\u2013 long before the real production systems are installed. Extensive analysis tools, such as bottleneck analysis, statistics and charts give us an opportunity to evaluate different manufacturing scenarios. The results provide us with the information needed to make fast, reliable, smarter decisions in the early stages of production planning. In addition, we can also optimize material flow, resource utilization and logistics for all levels of plant planning from global production facilities, through local plants, to specific lines. This helps to fulfil the user\\u2019s need to deliver just-in-time (JIT) or just-in-sequence (JIS).  Benefits  Increase existing system productivity  Optimize resource consumption and re-use  Optimize systems for reduced energy consumption  Shorten new product introduction, time-to market, and time-to-volume  Improve production layout and minimize investments  Ensure that machines and equipment are in the right place  Ensure that sufficient material handling equipment is available  Optimize buffer sizes  Ensure that product handling is kept to a minimumApart from advance simulation another disruptive innovation is the concept of digital twin. With the growing deployments of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, the importance of the concept of a digital avatar of a physical thing has gathered significant interest in the recent years. A digital twin can be defined, fundamentally, as an evolving digital profile of the historical and current behavior of a physical object or process that helps optimize business performance.A digital twin enables flexibility in manufacturing to reduce time needed for product design, manufacturing process and system planning and production facility design. A digital twin improves quality and even supports new business models that offer opportunities for small- to mid-size companies to expand and bring more high-tech capability into their shops. Digital twins will help all companies become more flexible, reduce time to market, reduce cost, improve quality and increase productivity at all levels of the organization. Digital twin business values: 1. Quality  Improve overall quality  Predict and detect quality trend defects sooner  Control quality escapes and be able to determine when quality issue started 2. Warranty cost and services  Understand current configuration of equipment in the field to be able to service more efficiently  Proactively and more accurately determine warranty and claims issues to reduce overall warranty cost and improve customer experiences 3. Operations cost  Improve product design and engineering change execution  Improve performance of manufacturing equipment  Reduce operations and process variability 4. Record retention and serialization  Create a digital record of serialized parts and raw materials to better manage recalls and warranty claims and meet mandated tracking requirements 5. New product introduction cost and lead time  Reduce the time to market for a new product  Reduce overall cost to produce new product 6. Revenue growth opportunities  Identify products in the field that are ready for upgrade   Improve efficiency and cost to service productThese digital twins use data from sensors that are installed on physical objects to represent their near real time status, working condition or position. Nonetheless, advances in computer science have made it possible to broaden the scope of the digital twin to include many more capabilities, information, inputs and outputs. It also helps you develop and introduce new products to the market much faster than ever.    ,  Under Samarth Udyog Mission of the Ministry of Heavy Industry (MHI), Govt. of India, IIT Delhi, and Automation Industry Association (AIA) together with Industry sponsors have set up common engineering facilities under the aegis of the IITD - AIA Foundation for Smart Manufacturing (FSM). These facilities are meant to demonstrate, support, and develop Smart Manufacturing concepts for Indian Industry & try them out in their own plants.

Safety demands that residual risks arising from a plant or machine do not exceed acceptable values. This includes hazards to the plant environment (e.g. environmental damage) as well as hazards within the plant or machine (e.g. people inside the plant). One option for the worst case is simply to interrupt the energy supply straight away and bring the machine to a hard stop. The traditional way of providing scope for this is by means of special safety wiring and components such as safety relays. Because this approach is very much hardware-based and therefore static, it is not particularly suitable for intelligent manufacturing processes where plant layouts continually need to be changed. A hard shutdown is generally associated with further disadvantages, whether these involve loss of productivity, extended downtimes due to more complex recommissioning procedures or a restriction in the machine\\u2019s operating and maintenance concept.   An alternative is offered by dynamic safety concepts based on an integrated view of changing automation processes and functional safety requirements. This changes the view of safety itself; it is regarded less as a hardware characteristic and more as a cross-device function. This approach allows processes to be operated in a safely controlled manner without any need to interrupt them immediately every time a fault occurs. But the dynamic approach can only be implemented efficiently if functional safety is built into automation projects from the moment they are planned. ,  An Augmented Reality application to show the Real-time Values of the 4 stations of the FSM Smart Mechanism Kit by connecting with KEPServer and getting tag values ,  Augmented RealityIIoT ,  02Realtime Monitoring ,  Robotic Welding Cell demonstrates a flexible manufacturing cell meaning it has an inventory of its own, material handling system, variety of parts with dynamic-order.This welding cell can be a part of production line and act as standalone system.Use of single or multiple robots may involve use of a PLC also.This cell uses a saftey PLC.This cell has all these features and the basis of selection can be done in a way that the cell will be programmed, utilization of peripheral devices (proximity sensors, pneumatic cylinders), safety devices and Automatic Identification & Data Capturing (AIDC) devices like RFID, vision camera etc. The cell has following level of flexibility but the decision can be made on the basis of the flexibility required as per the following parameters:1. Variety of parts for simultaneous production 2. Change of schedule3. Ready for new partWorkstations and layout design :Workstations in the cell are as per the following given applications and subject to following parameters : 1. Load/Unload stations for the cell: It is the area where the raw materials are incepted in/out of the cell.2. Inventory storage area: An inventory storage where the storage of the raw material is kept.3. Inspection area: An area where the material post operations are inspected for quality. This is kept as a separate unit away from the cell but it can be an integral part of the cell itself.4. Operations area: An area where the operations like welding is performed. In the cell , this area is more of a workspace since two robots are responsible for performing welding on the material. And it can be anywhere in the robot's workspace. 5. Layout design: It is an integral part before identifying the robots and environment preparation and also plays a key role in safety of the cell.CAD Design & Simulation: The 3D visualization and detailing of the cell is done using a designing software. The robotic path simulation software asists in defining the best possible, collision free environment that is going to be the basis of the layout design and all other hardware that are going to be installed in the cell. Apart from designing & fabrication of the cell it helps in performing the robot simulations to generate offline program, collision free environment (this is how the level of flexibility achieved) for robots at operating stage and generating Augmented Reality applications. ,  The cell programming can be done in atleast two ways. Online programming where  teach pendant is used and other is offline programming where the simulation is done in a separate software like RoboDK and KUKA Sim4. This helps in visualising and performing collision free path generation for both the robots. The video below demonstrates the offline programming method where we can see two robots performing indexed type motion. The offline programming helps in virtual commissioning and without impacting the production.  ,  Simulation & Testing ,  Job work & research ,  Prototyping ,  Customer Order Proessing ,  Site Integration ,  Machine-as-a-service ,  <-Multi Process Robotic Cell ,  Mobile Collaborative Robot-> ,  Smart sensors are a prerequisite for creating the best possible basis for a future-oriented automation system. This is because the smart factory needs data that can principally only be provided by smart, intelligent and communication-enabled sensors. Communication-enabled means being able to exchange sensor data with a machine controller or a cloud-based application. Thus, for example, sensor parameters are automatically adapted to new production orders within seconds. Or a light barrier detects contamination of its optics and reports this directly to the control center.   Smart Sensors generate and receive data and information which goes beyond traditional switching signals or measured process parameters. They therefore enable substantial increases in efficiency, more flexibility, and better planning security for predictive plant maintenance. Depending on the requirement, Smart Sensors cover up to four dimensions of Smart Sensor technology.   1. Enhanced sensing 2. Efficient communication 3. Diagnostics 4. Smart tasks Just like smart sensors, smart actuators also have intelligence built into them. Some of the smart features possessed by different types of actuators are:   Open standards: Multi-protocol communication interface allow universal operation with diverse, ethernet-based communication protocols Web-based commissioning and diagnostics via integrated web server Comprehensive access to actuator data (e.g. torque or power), via web connector for preventive maintenance or database interfacing and data analysis Inbuilt smart sensors for capturing data Flexible configuration according to requirement Comprehensive condition monitoring for fast identification of critical conditions and comfortable analysis Simple connection to higher-level data systems without additional hardware Workpiece-dependent parameters setting guaranteeing quality results Integrated control system with browser-based operating system allows for information sharing across multi vendor data systems  ,  Robotic Welding Cell demonstrates a flexible manufacturing cell meaning it has an inventory of its own, material handling system, variety of parts with dynamic-order.This welding cell can be a part of production line and act as standalone system.Use of single or multiple robots may involve use of a PLC also.This cell uses a saftey PLC.This cell has all these features and the basis of selection can be done in a way that the cell will be programmed, utilization of peripheral devices (proximity sensors, pneumatic cylinders), safety devices and Automatic Identification & Data Capturing (AIDC) devices like RFID, vision camera etc. The cell has following level of flexibility but the decision can be made on the basis of the flexibility required as per the following parameters:1.

The physical object is made from a three-dimensional digital model, typically by laying down many thin layers of a material in succession. With 3D printing it is possible to go directly from digital design data to a final part with no intermediate production steps. 3D printing technologies therefore eliminate the need for tooling and the associated capital investment. The result is that companies that adopt 3D printing can disrupt the traditional economies of scale, by allowing cost-effective production of single-unit or low-volume batches with low-volume part production, products can be customized to local markets, or even to individual customer tastes, driving adoption within industries as diverse as fashion, health care and automotive. Moreover, with the ability to print on demand, businesses also have the opportunity to eliminate inventory and cut aftermarket lead-times by providing digital spare-parts catalogues that can be printed when needed. The smart companies of the future will be those that have a clear strategy for how and where 3D printing fits within their supply chain and their value chain. They will also understand the business drivers to adoption.   From the student\\u2019s study to the professional designer\\u2019s office, from the dental laboratory to the jewellery retailer, from the aerospace factory to the hospital basement, 3D printers have become invaluable business tools. Applications and reasons are as diverse as the users. What links all these applications and users is one underlying ability: to transition 3D information digitally and seamlessly from the virtual world to the real world with nothing but a computer and a3D printer \\u2013 from bytes to bits.   The benefits of 3D printing today go way beyond just making models and prototypes. 3D printing is becoming a way of making components, systems and products sold across the supply chain, from the bracket in the aircraft door to the dental aligner in the teenager\\u2019s mouth. It can also be used for the manufacturing of tools, jigs and fixtures in addition to rapid prototyping. ,  An AR application designed to run on HoloLens 2 to demonstrate the entire sequence for Motor Replacement in the FSM Smart Mechanism Kit.The application uses a model target to detect the real mechanism kit and then superimpose the AR kit.The application will guide in tool selection and then show the steps to replace the motor.Voice updates are given to the user with each step.The user can also control the application sequence using voice commands. ,  Augmented RealityMicrosoft HoloLens 2 ,  01Self-Guided Training ,  04Self-Guided Maintenance ,  02Action Latency Reduction ,  03Insight Latency Reduction ,  IITD-AIA Foundation For Smart Manufacturing presents a comprehensive Learning Module on  Industrial Automation and IoT using soft-PLC Program, visualize, execute remote monitoring, motion programming and more using soft-PLC on the upcoming Learning Module.
